"""Event loop and related classes.

The event loop can be broken up into a pollster (the part responsible
for telling us when file descriptors are ready) and the event loop
proper, which wraps a pollster with functionality for scheduling
callbacks, immediately or at a given time in the future.

Whenever a public API takes a callback, subsequent positional
arguments will be passed to the callback if/when it is called.  This
avoids the proliferation of trivial lambdas implementing closures.
Keyword arguments for the callback are not supported; this is a
conscious design decision, leaving the door open for keyword arguments
to modify the meaning of the API call itself.

There are several implementations of the pollster part, several using
esoteric system calls that exist only on some platforms.  These are:

- kqueue (most BSD systems)
- epoll (newer Linux systems)
- poll (most UNIX systems)
- select (all UNIX systems, and Windows)
- TODO: Support IOCP on Windows and some UNIX platforms.

NOTE: We don't use select on systems where any of the others is
available, because select performs poorly as the number of file
descriptors goes up.  The ranking is roughly:

  1. kqueue, epoll, IOCP
  2. poll
  3. select

TODO:
- Optimize the various pollsters.
- Unittests.
